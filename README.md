# Predicting-Heart-Disease-using-Machine-Learning
Artificial Intelligence, particularly Machine Learning (ML), has made significant strides
in various research domains. This paper explores the application of machine learning in detecting
heart diseases, a prevalent and life-threatening condition affecting numerous individuals globally.
By leveraging attributes such as chest pain, cholesterol levels, and age, machine learning
algorithms, specifically supervised learning methods, play a pivotal role in diagnosing
cardiovascular diseases. This study employs three prominent algorithms—K-Nearest Neighbor
(KNN), Random Forest, and Logistic Regression—to classify individuals with heart diseases and
those without. The results indicate a prediction accuracy of 73.82% for KNN, 79.36% for Random
Forest, and 78.53% for Logistic Regression, showcasing the effectiveness of these algorithms in
disease diagnosis.
